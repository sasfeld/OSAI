Hi everyone,
for the part 3 of the practical task (Page 11) I wrote this command:
java -cp ../libs/h2. jar:bin/ org. h2. tools. Server
You need to adjust the paths behind -cp. This should work fine on <REMOVED_PERSON_ENTITY> and Mac but for <REMOVED_PERSON_ENTITY> the paths need to be separated with a ";" instead of a ":" . So please adjust that for <REMOVED_PERSON_ENTITY> to make it work.
If you got any questions, please use this forum.
