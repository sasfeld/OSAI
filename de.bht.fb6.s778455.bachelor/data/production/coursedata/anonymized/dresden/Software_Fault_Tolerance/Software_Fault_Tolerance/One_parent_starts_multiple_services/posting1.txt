Hello,
we learned in the lesson how to restart a service by a parent process Ã  la
```ruby
while(1){
  pid = fork();
  if (!pid){
    break;
  }
  waitpid(pid);
}
```
Is there an equal solution to restart one service out of multiple services by only one parent like a proxy? Or is it easier to use an infinite loop on parent's side where we have to check if every service is running and restarting it when not?
Greetings
