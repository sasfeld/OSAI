CONTENT:
The function `wait` has two branches that are entered depending on the return value of `getAndDecrement`, which atomically decrements 'count' and returns its previous value. `get` returns the current value. So the last thread to enter `wait` will find a return value of 1 (the previous value, the current value after decrement is 0) and resets the barrier. All other threads wait for 'count' to become 0.
