CONTENT:
for slides of PFD, it seems page 65 conflicts with page 64.
page 64 says process q broadcasts alive messages to other processes periodically. then ping should be sent from q and received by p.
then on page 65, a broadcast message include Cp(). how <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> q's alive message have p's current time? then, the following function is for q to receive message from p. how so? i mean, p does not send any messages.
i think page 65 must reverses the roles of detection, am i right?
