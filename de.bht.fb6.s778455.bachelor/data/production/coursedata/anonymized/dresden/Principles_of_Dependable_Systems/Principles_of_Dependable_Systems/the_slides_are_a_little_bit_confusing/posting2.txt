The slides are indeed a bit confusing.
1. On slide 64, you should image that process p also broadcasts to q. If there would be another process r, then p and q would be sending pings to r as well.
2. The code afterwards <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> be seen as the following:
```
last_ping[N] = now();
every P milliseconds do {
  broadcast (ping, Ci());
}
on receive (ping, T) from j {
  if (last_ping[j] < T) last_ping[j] = T;
}
bool suspected?(j) {
  if (last_ping[j] < Ci() - D) return true;
  else return false;
}
```
Where `i` is the process id of the process that runs the code and `j` is the process id of another process, either the id of the process that sent the ping, or the process id of the process being queried with `suspected?`.
All processes run the **same** code. What changes is their process id. Process p has i = p and process q has i = q.
