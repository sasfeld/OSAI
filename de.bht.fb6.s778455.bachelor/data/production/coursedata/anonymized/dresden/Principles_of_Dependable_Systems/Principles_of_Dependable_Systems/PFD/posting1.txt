There are few doubts
**1**  
```
time last_ping[N] = 0;
bool suspected?(q) {
if (last_ping[q] == 0) {
send(“ping”) to q;
last_ping[q] = Cp
();
return false;
} if (last_ping[q] < Cp()-2δ-2σ) {
return true;
} else
return false;
}
```
In this case does it mean that if the last_ping[q] is less than the condition, then its value lies outside Cp()-2δ-2σ) then the overall time for ping and pong is more than 2δ+2σ?
**2** 
what does the graph in slide 130 of PFD show? it is not that clear to me/
