<REMOVED_PERSON_ENTITY> UML is the best UML tool on the market because it supports at best (conformant) the UML standard (UML metamodel).
The idea to use XMI for the exchange of UML models (not diagrams because diagrams only have no semantics) is basically ok. However in practice of state-of-the-art UML tools this does not really work.
At first you have to choose the right metamodel for the exchange (EMF version ..., MOF version ...).
Then it could basically work with a few exceptions because of the UML tool's extensions.
In last years this situation is becoming better but in my experience there is still no satisfying solution.
Therefore it is better to work with MagicDraw UML.
Let me say it again: We do not need the diagrams we need for evaluation the models behind the diagrams!
And, we <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> be lucky to get the Professional Edition from NoMagic!
