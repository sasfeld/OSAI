I don't think I <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> be lucky to use a proprietary software instead of Free Software.
But actually your suggest brings us to a solution that is satisfaying for both sides. With papyrus uml I get a model. uml File, that <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> be imported into MagicDraw. You then get the model, but not the diagram. But as you said, the Model is all you want (not the diagram). So <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> you tell me, if this works out for you or the chair?
EDIT: I have tested the import in MagicDraw and it seems to work. Maybe I <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> send you the *. uml File so you <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> check it out for yourself?
