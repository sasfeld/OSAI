CONTENT:
Still students are forced to accept the license agreement of MagicDraw. If someone is at least a bit concerned about who collects which data about him (and we all should be VERY concerned about this topic), this someone will find himself unable to accept such a restraining agreement. I think it sends the wrong signals to push students toward using tools (even if they offer certain benefits) no matter what.
