Hi,
I was <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> going over the slides of todays tutorial (found in the Google cache) and I have a problem on slide 5.
It says: 
$$P(X_1) = \frac{h}{m+h}  imes \frac{h}{m+h-1}$$.
Shoudn't it be:
$$P(X_1) = \frac{h}{m+h}  imes \frac{ extbf{m}}{m+h-1}$$?
So, the probability of receiving a healthy packet multiplied by the probability of receiving a malicious packet next (as per definition of $X_i$)?
