Sorry guys, the swap of SE1 and SE2 this week was supposed to be announced on <REMOVED_PERSON_ENTITY> during the lecture. The ultimate solution is to look into our Google calendar, which we always keep up to date (http://se.inf.tu-dresden. de/teaching/courses/).
Note that we will have another swap from Dec 13th to 11th (https://auditorium. inf. tu-dresden. de/posts/3024).
