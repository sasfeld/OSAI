CONTENT:
I have difficulties to get the example pong server running. It boots [this far](http://pastebin.com/APZ2Nc6q) but does not enter graphical mode.  
Here are my [pong. cfg](http://pastebin.com/t3Lf8TWN) and [modules. list entry](http://pastebin.com/Y87hLVnL). Another Problem ist to figure out who needs which capability (and which Capability names to use).
