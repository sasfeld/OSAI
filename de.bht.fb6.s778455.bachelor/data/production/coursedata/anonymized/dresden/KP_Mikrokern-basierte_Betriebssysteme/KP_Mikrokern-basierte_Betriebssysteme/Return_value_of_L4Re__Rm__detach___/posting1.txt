CONTENT:
How do I have to understand the return values of [L4Re::Rm::Detach_result](http://os.inf.tu-dresden. de/L4Re/doc/classL4Re_1_1Rm. html#a43a67efc09d07fb2b0ed559184d4a883)?
1. Detached_ds 	*Detached data sapce.*  - Everything seems to be fine.
2. Kept_ds 	*Kept data space.* - Soâ€¦ detaching failed?
3. Split_ds  *Splitted data space, and done.* - I still do have some parts of the dataspace attached?
4. Detach_again  *Detached data space, more to do.* - Completely clueless here.
Additional Question: When I detached a dataspace, do I have to tell the dataspace manager, it <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> have its dataspace back for reuse or does it happen automatically?
