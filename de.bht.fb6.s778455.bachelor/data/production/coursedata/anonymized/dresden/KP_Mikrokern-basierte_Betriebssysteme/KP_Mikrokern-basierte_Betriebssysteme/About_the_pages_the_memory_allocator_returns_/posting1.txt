CONTENT:
Unless specified otherwise the memory allocator is supposed to return pages of the size 4K = 4096 bytes.  
Is this architecture dependent or <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> I rely on this fact?  
Are the returned pages always aligned at a multiple of 4K?  
(I. e. do they start with addresses 0, 4K, 8K, 12K and so on?)
