CONTENT:
So, I tried to debug my issues by attaching GDB to QEMU. So far I did the following:  
 * adding the Options `-s -S` to `~/trunk/obj/l4/x86/conf/Makeconf. bbot` so *qemu* <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> be addressed by *gdb* and stops execution at the start of the program.  
* running *gdb* and connecting to *qemu* via `target remote localhost:1234`  
I know I have to load a file with a symbol table first, but <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> using the the . o-file of my program i. e. `file ~/trunk/obj/l4/x86/pkg/my_prog/OBJ-â€¦-x86/main. o`, which works but is only part of what I want. `break malloc` for example sets the breakpoint but it never triggers, even when calling *malloc()*.   
What am I doing wrong?
