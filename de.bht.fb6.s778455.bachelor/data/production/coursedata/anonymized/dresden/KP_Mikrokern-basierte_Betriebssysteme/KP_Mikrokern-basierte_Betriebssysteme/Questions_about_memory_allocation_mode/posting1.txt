CONTENT:
The [documentation](http://os.inf.tu-dresden. de/L4Re/doc/classL4Re_1_1Mem__alloc. html) states that there are three modes for requesting dataspces:
- *Continuous*
- *Pinned*
- *Super_pages*
What does *pinned* in this context mean?  
I assume a *Superpage* is simply a memory page with a size > 4K. What size does it have?
