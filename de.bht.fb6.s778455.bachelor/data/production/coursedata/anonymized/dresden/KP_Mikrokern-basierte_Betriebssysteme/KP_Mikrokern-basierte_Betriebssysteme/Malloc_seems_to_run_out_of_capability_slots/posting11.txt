CONTENT:
Okay, Ichecked all that. All sizes seem to be fine, the sizes passed to *mem_alloc()* and *attach()* are alway full page sizes ( i. e. multiples of 4096 ). There also seems never to be a mismatch between the size of the requested memory region and the size of the returned dataspace. Is there a possibility that I mess up something with the capabilities ( e. g. overriding a capability of a dataspace still in use)?
