CONTENT:
Okay, I tried something else: Instead of re-using the same capability for every dataspace, I used a new one for every DS I got and freed them, when I gave the DS back.  
This works fine... for a while, but then *cap_alloc* gave me a capability that was invalid.  
Is there a way to find out *why* a capability is invalid?  
Could this be a sign of running out of Cap-slots?  
How do I find out, how many slots I use?
