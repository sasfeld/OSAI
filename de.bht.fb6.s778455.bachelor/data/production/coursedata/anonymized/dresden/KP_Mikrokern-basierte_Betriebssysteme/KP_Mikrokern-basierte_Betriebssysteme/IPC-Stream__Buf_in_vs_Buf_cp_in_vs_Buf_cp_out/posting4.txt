CONTENT:
AFAIK, C++ strings use dynamic memory allocation, so it isn't possible to use them at the moment. At least I didn't manage to allocate something on the heap.
But than, when we have dynamic allocator, we will be able to use C++ strings' method c_str, that returns C-style string. So I don't think that there is big difference in using C-style and C++-style strings.
