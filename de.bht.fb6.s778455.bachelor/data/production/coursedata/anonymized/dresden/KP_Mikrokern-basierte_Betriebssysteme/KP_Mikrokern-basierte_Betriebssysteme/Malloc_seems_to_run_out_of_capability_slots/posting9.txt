CONTENT:
I improved my test program to write all the bytes in the allocated memory area and it turned out that I hit a page fault, slightly before the other error:
~~~~~
malloc-t| 	Request 428722 byte
malloc-t| INFO 	call to malloc
malloc-t| INFO 	Allocation successful
malloc-t| 	Got 0x1c6c54e
MOE: ds access out of bounds: offset=1000 size=1000
malloc-t| L4Re[rm]: mapping for page fault failed with -34 @1c6d000 pc=1000310
malloc-t| L4Re: unhandled exception: pc=0x1000310
~~~~~
Since everything else seems to work fine, I guess that the region I got from the region mapper was not what I wanted somehow. But neither *L4Re::Env::env()->mem_alloc()->alloc(…)* nor *L4Re::Env::env()->rm()->attach(…, L4Re::Rm::Search_addr, …)* returned an error. Is there a way of accessing the properties of the region to double-check it? Could I have messed up something with the flags I used (or didn't use)?
