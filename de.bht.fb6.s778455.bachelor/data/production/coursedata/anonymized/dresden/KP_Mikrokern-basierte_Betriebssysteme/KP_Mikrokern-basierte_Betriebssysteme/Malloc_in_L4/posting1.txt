CONTENT:
I thougt a bit about how to implement malloc() in L4:
- If one needs new memory pages one <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> ask the pager responsible for my address space
- Maybe one <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> provoke a page fault to ask for a new memory page
- A pager only hands out full pages
- So I have to manage the memory, I got from the pager myself
- That is why one might think of implementing malloc as a call to a memory management server...
Are my thoughts correct so far?
