CONTENT:
Manual says that `Buf_in `  provides a possibility to extract an array from an `Ipc::Istream`, without extra copy overhead. In contrast to `Buf_cp_in` the data is not copied to a buffer, but a pointer to the array is returned. So, in contrast to `Buf_cp_in`, using `Buf_in` you <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> get data without additional overhead, but you <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> spoil these data writing something into the stream.
And the `Buf_cp_out` is used to write data to output stream. You don't need to convert your string to `Buf_cp_out` as IPC stream interface supports zero-terminated strings.
So, for your goal both `Buf_in` and `Buf_cp_in` <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> be used, but first one is better.
