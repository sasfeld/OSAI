CONTENT:
I think it will work for both C and C++ since first you compile your malloc-library and than link it against your application. So C and C++ files do not intersect directly. Although there could be some issues if you use some features that are not available in C. Following discussion explains some issues with linking procedure: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7288404/linking-c-to-c-in-gcc
As I got this discussion you should use g++ for linking if you use such C++-features like exceptions, but if not object files generated from C++ sources should be completely compatible with C object files.
