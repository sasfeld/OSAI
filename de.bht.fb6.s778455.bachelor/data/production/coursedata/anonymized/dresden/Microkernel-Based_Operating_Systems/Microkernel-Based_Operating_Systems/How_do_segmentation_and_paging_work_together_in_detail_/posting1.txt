CONTENT:
My world view as for now is:  
 * there is segmentation which manages the access rights and properties of a memory region called segment  
 * there is an optional translation between virtual and physical addresses called paging  
 * The MMU handles both, the segment and page translation  
 * Today, mostly a flat memory model is used  
 * one distiguishes linear, logical, virtual and physical addresses  
*But now is the questions:*  
How do paging and segmentation interlock?  
Does both happen in parallel or is one done before another?  
Are theese strictly seperated mechanisms or are they <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> different views of the same thing?  
And what is meant by *linear* and *logical* addresses exactly? It <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> seems like they are different names for virtual addresses.
