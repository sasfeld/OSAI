CONTENT:
In the memory lecture we learn why hierarchical paging is needed and how it <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> occur that several pagers are responsible for the same address space. On slide 31 problems are described which lead into the solution of having a region manager thread within each AS. These problems are not really clear to me:
1. The slides say, the pager needed to specify the send base. I didn't find out from the slides, what the send base actually is. I have an idea, but a clear definition would be nice.
2. Why does the pager need to know the client's AS layout? Does it not suffice to have the page fault address and hence the missing page in the application? 
3. In which way <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> conflicts occur if 2 pagers are responsible for 1 AS? I understand that, if 2 pagers have the same page frame mapped into their address space, this frame might be accessed concurrently by 2 different threads. However this problem is not solved by the region manager? So which conflicts <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> occur, that <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> be solved by a region manager?
