CONTENT:
The kernel then uses *virtual* addresses between `0xc000 0000` and `0xffff ffff` internally, which will never be handed out by any pager / dataspace manager because it is reserved for the kernel use only. Is this achieved by the root pager never handing out these virtual adresses or does the kernel itself prevent a address translation by user-level applications to its reserved virtual addresses?
