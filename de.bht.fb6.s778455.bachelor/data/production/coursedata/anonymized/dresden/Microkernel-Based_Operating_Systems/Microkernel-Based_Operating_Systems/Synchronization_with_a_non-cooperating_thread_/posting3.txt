CONTENT:
I wanted to avoid to bother the kernel itself with synchronization issues. That is why I proposed to introduce a new level of privilege. I am thinking of the synchronization components as a seperated, centralized and independent building block in the OS design.
Since critical sections are used to protect hardware ressources one <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> imagine something like a critical section scheduler and a synchronzation server for each of theese ressources. All this stuff is thougt to run in another privilege level then the applications. I wanted to use mechanisms comparable to the ones used for the kernel mode switch, but simply not the kernel itselfâ€¦
