To quote the seL4 manual (http://www.ertos.nicta.com.au/research/sel4/sel4-refman. pdf):
> The kernel keeps a record of the derivation tree for capabilities. This tree is stored in the mapping database, and is used when revoking a capability to locate the capabilities which must be deleted. This is similar to previous L4 kernels, except that the storage for the mapping database is not dynamically allocated in seL4 â€” every capability table slot includes some space reserved for a mapping database node.
