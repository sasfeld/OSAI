CONTENT:
It doesn't matter _where_ memory is. It matters _who_ issues the read/write operation. If the CPU accesses memory the MMU is used. If a device accesses memory, the IOMMU is used. Think of the IOMMU being implemented between PCI bus and memory controller translating every transaction coming from the PCI bus (this is a bit simplified) and the MMU sitting between CPU and memory controller.
