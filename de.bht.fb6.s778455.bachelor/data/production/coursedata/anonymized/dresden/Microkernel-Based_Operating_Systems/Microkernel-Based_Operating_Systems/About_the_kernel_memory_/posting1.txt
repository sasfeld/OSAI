CONTENT:
As far as I know, the kernel memory resides in the higher 1GB of  *??? memory*. 
Does it operate directly on the physical memory or does it have a virtual memory mapping?  
From an applications view <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> there be a memory mapping to the highest GB in virtual memory?  
Do *Sigma0* or the *mapping database* know about the kernels memory area?
