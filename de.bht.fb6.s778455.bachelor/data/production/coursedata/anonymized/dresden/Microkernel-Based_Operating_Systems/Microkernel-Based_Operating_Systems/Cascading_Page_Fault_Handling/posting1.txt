CONTENT:
What happens when a application requests memory hence causing a pager fault and the corresponding pager itself has no memory to spare?
* Will the pager itself generate a page fault *during* page fault handling?
Is this considered a double fault?
* Will the pager grant memory it does not have to *resolve* the page fault *before* causing another page fault itself?
* Will the pager answer with an error and hand out no new memory? Or will it point the application to another pager?
Does this even matter?
