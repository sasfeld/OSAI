CONTENT:
The operating system and the BIOS/firmware <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> decide where to map individual device memory in the physical address range. Few devices support 64-bit addresses, most only 32-bit. That is why even on 64-bit systems most device memory is located between 3 and 4GB in the physical address range.
You seem to confuse this with virtual memory somehow. For the OS device memory looks like normal RAM in that it <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> be mapped page-wise into virtual address spaces. The only difference is access latency, bandwidth and cachability.
