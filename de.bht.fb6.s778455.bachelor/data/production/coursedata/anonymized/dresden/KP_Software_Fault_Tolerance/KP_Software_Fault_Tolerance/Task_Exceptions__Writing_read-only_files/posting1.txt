CONTENT:
In "Test 2" we have to throw an exception if someone wants to write a read-only file. So I implemented a read-only check into the write method. "Test 7" opens a file read only and wants to write to it. This results obviously in an exception. But I get the hint: "An Exception was thrown albeit none should!". Did you discover the same thing? I must admit that I don't have a clue how to solve this.
