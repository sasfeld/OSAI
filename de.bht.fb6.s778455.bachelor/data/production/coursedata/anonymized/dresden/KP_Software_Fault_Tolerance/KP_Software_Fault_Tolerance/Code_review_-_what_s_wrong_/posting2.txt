Hi <REMOVED_PERSON_ENTITY>,
Example 1:
* First answer is not completely right. The try-catch block has no effect since fclose is a C function. So the programmer simply did not understand that C function throw no exceptions.
* Second answer is correct.
Example 2:
* Answer seems also to be correct. I have to check again.
My suggestion is to you to create a question for the first to answers and then post the answer. (please post the answer as an answer, and the question as a question).
Regarding the third one, I'll get back to you once I think a little bit more. There might be another reason I can't remember.
Thanks for your answers!
