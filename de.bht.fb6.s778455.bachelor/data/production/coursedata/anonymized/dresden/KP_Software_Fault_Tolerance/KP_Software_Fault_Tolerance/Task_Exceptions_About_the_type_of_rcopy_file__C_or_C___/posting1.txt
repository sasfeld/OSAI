CONTENT:
As the Task1 says:
Where and how <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> you use exceptions in your rcopy application? Extend the C Version of rcopy with exceptions (of course now in C++). Do not reuse your C++ version from task 1. Write C++ wrapper classes for your C solution!
It seems like that we should complete the recopy using C.
But in repository of svn, the preset rcopy file is C++.
From my opinion, we should use C++ to complete the rcopy for the reason we must handle the exceptions in the program.
Am I right? What's your guys opinion?
