Hello,
I got the following output of the test system: 
> Died at parseOutput. pl <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> 22,  <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> 43.
Expected injection "read_EIO" was "Injected:  faultinjectors/fi_read_EIO. so"subtask failed
FAILED
I read_EIO fails and the contents of the tar differ. So, my script prints 
> Injected:  faultinjectors/fi_read_EIO. <PERSONAL_GREETING_REMOVEMENT>
ProcessState:  exited
TarState:  corrupted
What is the reason for the error message? Thanks
