CONTENT:
If you have the order of the for loops correct (outer loop should be CSTR_count and inner FILE_count, as in the slides), then the next probable errors is the waitpid.
You might be handling incorrectly the return values of waitpid. The tests we run in the testing system are a bit more complete than those you run locally. So please, double check that you are doing the right with when the waitpid returns.
