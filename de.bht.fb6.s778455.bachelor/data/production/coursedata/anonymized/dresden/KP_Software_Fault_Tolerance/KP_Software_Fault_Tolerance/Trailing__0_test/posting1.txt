CONTENT:
Hi,
I am a bit confused right now. For the test cases without a trailing \0, my implementation has the same issue as strlen. It will eventually find a \0, but this will occur somewhere after the end of the string.
```c
     // or <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> use strlen( s ) :-P
     // bogus happens if there is no \0 for strlen and this
     for( int i = 0; ; i++ ) 
       if( *(s + i) == '\0' ) break;
```
So isn't that faulty behaviour?
Is there any way to test for the end of a string, if \0 is missing?
