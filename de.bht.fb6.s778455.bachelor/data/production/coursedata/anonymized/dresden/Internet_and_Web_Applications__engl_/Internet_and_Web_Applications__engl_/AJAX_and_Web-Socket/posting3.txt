CONTENT:
Since I think Adai is refering to the communication model taxonomy of Prof. <REMOVED_PERSON_ENTITY>, which counts AJAX as a non blocking technique where WebSocket is regarded as fully asynchronous, I wanted to add the following: 
According to the script (page 34), the main feature of AJAX is wiping off the "click, wait, and refresh" paradigm, leading to a non blocking approach. Still, there is a high dependance between HTTP requests/response involved. For every serverside update there is HTTP communication going between the AJAX engine and the server itself.
In contrast to that, WebSocket is using HTTP for establishing the websocket stream. As <REMOVED_PERSON_ENTITY> already mentioned, it uses full-duplex communication, so there aren't any drawbacks of long-polling.
