CONTENT:
My question is if we use below  barrier for 2 threads why the thread A cannot detect  when count == 0 ,( done by thread B) and waiting for phase 1 to finish. (Because , count is an AtomicInteger. I hope there is no effect of private caches as every read and write are done atomically.)  why count. get() doesn't result as 0.  Please correct me. Where I got lost this.

```c++

public class Barrier {

  AtomicInteger count;

  int size;

  publicBarrier(int n) {

    count = AtomicInteger(n);

    size = n;

  }

  public void wait() {

    if (count. getAndDecrement() == 1) {

      count. set(size);

    } else {

      while (count. get() != 0);

    }

  }

}

```
