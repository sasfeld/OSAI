Hey everybody,

I cannot get test3 working and get the following error message from the test system:

> *** glibc detected *** ./t3: double free or corruption (top): 0x095af008 ***

After that i get the representation of the Memory map. 

I have checked it using valgrind (without further parameters) and it should be ok (8 allocs and 8 frees), so i'm not sure what is wrong. Running it with several test files (empty, non-existent, missing permissions) works fine. 

Could someone give me a clue as to what is being tested in test3? 

Thanks!
