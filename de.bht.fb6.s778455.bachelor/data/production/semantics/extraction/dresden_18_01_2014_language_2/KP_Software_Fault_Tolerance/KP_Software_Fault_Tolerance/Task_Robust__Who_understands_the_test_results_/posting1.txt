When I commit my codes, the result shows:

```ruby

96 out of 96 expected tests run (100. 00%)

15 out of 96 tests return unexpected result (15. 62%)

95 expected tests are untested (11945302443632432200549030327740015590695911560848032952424821457274910021501684307757466079648660062208. 00%)

*** Output from our 'stats' library ***

failed: 15

tested: 96

expected: 96

untested: 95

```

I cannot understand the result. First it shows "96 out of 96 expected tests run". However, in the third <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT>, it shows "95 expected tests are untested".

Are there 96 + 95 = 191 tests altogether? But I <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> only find 96 tests.(12 file test cases combined with 8 string test cases).

Who understands it and <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> explain for me?
