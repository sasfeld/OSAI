CONTENT:
strlen <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> checks if there is anywhere a \0, as c strings end with this symbol by definition. If my string violates this definition, strlen stops counting, when it finds a \0 anywhere behind the string in the memory. 

I don't consider this a safe way to check for strlen, but I don't know about any other way either. My question is more about, is there any way to do this right and not <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> 'working'?
