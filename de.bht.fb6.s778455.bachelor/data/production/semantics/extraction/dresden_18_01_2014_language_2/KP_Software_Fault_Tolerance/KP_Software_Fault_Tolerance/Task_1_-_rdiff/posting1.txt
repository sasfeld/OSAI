CONTENT:
Hello,

I'm having a little trouble with the test cases of the rdiff task. I check for the usual suspects (files null, length, fread does not read  of data) but obviously that is not enough.

Could you please give me a hint as to what else to test/look for? 

Sadly, printfs do work for rcopy but do not work for rdiff. Has it been disabled intentionally?

Thanks!

PS: a simple hello world passes 2 of the test cases. I wonder why that is...
