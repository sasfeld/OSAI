CONTENT:
<NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> u explain further about UNCP-store and UNCP-trace? and what is the difference between them?

I got the main idea of Rendezvous points. i think the points cut the whole process into many small phases. at the end of these phases, we check the intermediate results of different CPUs. so, we <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> synchronize the results at these points and don't care about the order of signal processing between the points. am i right?

but still, i don't get many concepts of UNCP-store and UNCP-trace. like:

what are retired instructions?

what does "differ by at most N instructions" mean? what if the difference exceeds N?

besides, what does 3N instructions mean in UNCP-trace?

<NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> u explain these concepts further? btw, <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> u also explain the examples on the slides?
