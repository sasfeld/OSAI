CONTENT:
thank u for the [answer](https://auditorium. inf. tu-dresden. de/posts/509#post-510). it is much clear to me now.

but i still have a few following questions:

1. for rendezvous protocol, the highest VRO-number is choosen to process the irq. so the fastest PE <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> process the irq immediately. what should other PEs do? should they wait until they reach the highest VRO-number?

2. for resynchronization approach, u still did not explain what the retired instructions mean. why should the maximum number of retired instructions be determined?

3. about the copying issue of UNCP-store, i still can't get where/when the copy happens. i mean, take 3 processors as a example, P1 finishes VRO point 1 and 2 and executes toward 3, P2 is executing toward 4, P3 is executing toward 5. should they copy the value at point 1 and 2? or the value at point 4 (only P3 finishes this point)?
