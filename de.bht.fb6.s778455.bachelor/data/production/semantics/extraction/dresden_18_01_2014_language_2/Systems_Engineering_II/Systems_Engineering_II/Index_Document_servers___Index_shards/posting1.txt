CONTENT:
So regarding to my last question, I now found that the index is a list of URLs that stored in some kind of database, is it correct?

If so I do have another two question:

1. Are the Index server and Document server also the database that store the corresponding information? Or they are <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> servers and there is separate database?

2. Are all the shards contains exactly the same information? If they are, then my understanding "the index is a list of URLs" doesn't make sense; if they are not, what if the shard selected by load balancer to process the enquiry doesn't have the information for this enquiry (I think it's not gonna be re-directed to other shards)?

A bit confusing...

Thanks for anyone that <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> help.
