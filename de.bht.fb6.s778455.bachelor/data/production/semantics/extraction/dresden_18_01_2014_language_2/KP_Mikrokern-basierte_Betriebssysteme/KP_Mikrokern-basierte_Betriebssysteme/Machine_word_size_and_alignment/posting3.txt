CONTENT:
To make #3 a bit clearer:

Let's assume we have a system with a machine word size of 8 bytes. I start a memory access at address **0x1000** and write a structure containing **9 bytes**. So I assume the size of the structure is rounded up to the next multiple of the machine word size which is **16 bytes**. <REMOVED_PERSON_ENTITY> the next address behind this structure would be 

**0x1000 + sizeof( structure ) = 0x1010**

Does this rounding up always <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT>? Or <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> there be other funny alignment effects?
