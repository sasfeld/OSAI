CONTENT:
And who should do the rounding?

If you have a struct of size 9 bytes then the only thing you <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> be sure about is that this struct will be 9 bytes large. If the compiler makes it larger, you <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> get 16 bytes. The `sizeof` operator is your friend then.

What is the actual problem you are trying to solve?
