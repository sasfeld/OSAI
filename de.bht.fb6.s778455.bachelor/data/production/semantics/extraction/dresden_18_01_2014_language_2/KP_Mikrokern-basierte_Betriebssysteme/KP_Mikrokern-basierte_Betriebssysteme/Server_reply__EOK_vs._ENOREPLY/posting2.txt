CONTENT:
You already found the right place to search for. The server class is responsible for receiving requests and dispatching the answers. It has a function `reply_n_wait` that performs the actions to receive requests. If the `dispatch` function returns ENOREPLY, it only waits for a new incoming message. Otherwise it uses the `reply_and_wait` IPC system call to send an answer and then immediately wait for the next incoming message.

The client is not involved in ENOREPLY at all. This code simply tells the framework to not send a reply, regardless of whether the client waits for one or not. If the client waits and the server does not send a reply, the client will simply be blocked in an `ipc_call` forever.
