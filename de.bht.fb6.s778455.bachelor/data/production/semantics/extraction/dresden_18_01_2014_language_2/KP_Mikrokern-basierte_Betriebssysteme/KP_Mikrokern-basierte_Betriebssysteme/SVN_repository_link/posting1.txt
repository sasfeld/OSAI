CONTENT:
The given link to the repository http://os.inf.tu-dresden. de/Studium/Praktikum/src/trunk/kpr/ does not seem to exist.

I <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> cut it to http://os.inf.tu-dresden. de/Studium/Praktikum/src/trunk and it seems to do fine. Or was the subdirectory **kpr** intended to have contained something special?
