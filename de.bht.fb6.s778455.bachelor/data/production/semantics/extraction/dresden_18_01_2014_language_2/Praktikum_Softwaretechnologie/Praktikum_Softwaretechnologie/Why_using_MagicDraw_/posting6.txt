CONTENT:
There is the uml Diagram Exchange Data Format. It is standardised by the OMG. The Free Software Tool Papyrus UML supports this Format. Would this be acceptable? 

I don't like to accept the proprietary license of MagicDraw, so I won't be able to use it. And there are other students, who don't want accept this kind of license. And I don't understand why we are forced to use a proprietary software, when good Free Software tools are available.

I <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> fully understand the wish of getting a comparison of the solutions of all students, but I hope you will try to find a solution that doesn't force the students to use proprietary software, when good free software alternatives are available. Maybe you <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> tell us, which (open) format you expect us to submit.

Beste Regards,

<REMOVED_PERSON_ENTITY>, (student)
