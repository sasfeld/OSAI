CONTENT:
I'm looking forward to a clarification with respect to the connection between Dresden OCL, NoMagic and the chair. Cause I don't see why NoMagic would have to pay for implementation of Dresden OCLâ€¦? Also, I'd like to know whether the mentioned way of exporting the model in a common format is accepted by the chair.
