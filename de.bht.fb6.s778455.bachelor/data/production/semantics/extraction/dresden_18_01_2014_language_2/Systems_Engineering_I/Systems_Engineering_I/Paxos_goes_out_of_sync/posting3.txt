CONTENT:
Probably my picture is a bit imprecise. In the end I expect acceptors to have following values: ((2, y), (1, x), (2, y)). With cross I designated possible point of failure, so that everyone remembered some value, but there is no majority among values. 

 >and let's say that accept(2, y) was not lost (nor A2 crashed).

In my picture accept(2, y) is never lost. Cross means that A1 crashes and this happens after it remembers value (2, y). And A2 is also never crashed.  

> Eventually A2 will receive the prepare(2) and accept(2, y) and will overwrite its accepted value.

So, we should be able to overwrite the value that was written once. This, basically, answers my question. But is it possible to implement Paxos for acceptor that has only write-once storage?

> What if A1 crashes before A2 sees (2, y)?

This part is clear for me.

Thank you.
