CONTENT:
The kernel reserves a chunk of *physical* memory for itself and maps this into everyone's *virtual* top 1 GB region. Only the remainder of memory is made available to user space by passing it to sigma0 during startup.

Access to kernel memory from user space is prevented by the MMU using [page tables](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_table).
