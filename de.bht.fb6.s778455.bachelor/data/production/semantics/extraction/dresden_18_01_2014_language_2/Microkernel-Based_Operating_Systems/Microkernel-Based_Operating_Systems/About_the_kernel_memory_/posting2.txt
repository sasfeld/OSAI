CONTENT:
The (32bit) kernel memory resides in the top 1GB of every task's *virtual* memory. This simply means that the page table for every task for this region contains the same mappings across all tasks. This memory is owned and used by the kernel.

User applications <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> there not have memory mappings at addresses larger than 0xc0000000 (3GB).

Sigma0 is a user application and therefore does not know which memory is owned by the kernel.

The mapping database is part of the kernel itself.
