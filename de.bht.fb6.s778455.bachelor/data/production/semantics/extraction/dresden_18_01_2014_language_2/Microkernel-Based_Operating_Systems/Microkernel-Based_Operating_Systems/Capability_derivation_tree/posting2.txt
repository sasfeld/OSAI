CONTENT:
When you revoke an untyped root capability, ther kernel automatically destroys all capabilities derived from it. In this sense, th CDT is serves a similar purpose as the mapping database: allow recursive revocation. But other than the typical L4 mapping database, the CDT lives in the capability table and thus in user-provided memory.
