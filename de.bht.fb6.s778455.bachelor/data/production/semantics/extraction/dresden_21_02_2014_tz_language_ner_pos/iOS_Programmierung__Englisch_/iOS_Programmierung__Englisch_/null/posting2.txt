CONTENT:
Usually you open Xcode's Organizer (open Xcode, press Cmd+Shift+2). Connect your Device and choose it from list on the left, then click use for development. This should be everything.

Furthermore you don't need your own Provisioning Profile. You should only need your own certificate.

Maybe you need to add your dev account (apple id) to Xcode. You <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> do this in Xcode's preferences.
