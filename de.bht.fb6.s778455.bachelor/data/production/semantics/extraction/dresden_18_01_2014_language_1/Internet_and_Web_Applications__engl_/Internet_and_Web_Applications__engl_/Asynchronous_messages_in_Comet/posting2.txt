CONTENT:
The client browser sends an initial GET- or POST-Request. The web server responds with a special HTTP-Multipart-Response (Content-Type: multipart/mixed). Subsequent events on the server side then trigger the transmission of further "parts" of this multipart response message. Upon receiving such a message, a onreadystatechange-event is triggered in the client browser (with a status code unequal to "4", i. e. never reaching the "complete" state). 

Altogether, this means that the client itself does NOT have to do any polling for further messages, so the mechanism is fully asynchronous.
