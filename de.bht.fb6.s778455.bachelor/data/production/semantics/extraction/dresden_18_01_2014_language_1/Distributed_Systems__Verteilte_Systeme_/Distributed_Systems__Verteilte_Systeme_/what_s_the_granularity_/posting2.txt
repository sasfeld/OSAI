CONTENT:
The granularity refers to the size of the distribution units (i. e. processes or objects). In the client/server model, those (operating system level) processes are always large and heavyweight. In the object model, objects <NAME_CORPUS_REPLACEMENT> be of any size, i. e. also lightweight and therefore more efficient distribution units are explicitly supported. This is clearly an advantage.
