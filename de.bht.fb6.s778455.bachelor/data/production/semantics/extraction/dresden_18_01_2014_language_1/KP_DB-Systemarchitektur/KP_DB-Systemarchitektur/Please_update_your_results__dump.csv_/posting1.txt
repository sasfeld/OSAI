CONTENT:
I added kernelCopyTime measurements. So now scheduling and predictTime/saveFeedback use totalExecutionTime (executionTime + copyTime).

New dump. csv:

executionTime: kernelExecutionTime

NEWpredictTime: predicted time after execution

copyTime: kernelCopyTime (contains the copy time to and from the Device)

totalpredictedTime: predicts time before execution

totalExecutionTime: executionTime + copyTime

Now we have proper predictions and good device scheduling decisions.
